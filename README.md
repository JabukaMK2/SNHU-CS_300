# SNHU-CS_300

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we were tasked with creating a data scruture and algorythm that would allow a university named ABCU to store information on classes and their prerequisits.  This assignment was broken into two parts.  First we completed psuedocode and analysis of different data structures in project 1, then we put the plan into action.
   
3. How did you approach the problem?  Consider why data structures are important to understand.

For this problem I chose to use a tree as that was what I found to be the most effective way to meet the needs of ABCU.  After completing the project I relized that due to the small data set, a hash table or simple linked list may have been more effective.  However, I had planned on speed when accessing a large data set which I found a tree to acheive this best.

4. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Throughout the course we worked on assignments that focused on linked lists, hash tables, and trees.  Even at this point I dont fully understand hash tables and find it to be a blind spot.  Given time I am now more confident then I started but coding can have a steep learning curve, which is part of why its so satisfying!

5. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Algorythims covered in this course expanded my understanding of data structures and made me feel like the choices you make in programing are much more numerous.  Programing already felt large but now my understanding has expanded and I see how things like hash tables are used in gaming where speed is very important.

6. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I learned that coding with psuedocode is a great start but not to be too worried about changing my method while writing code.  Durring this course much of the code used was reusable which made me understand how important encapsulation is as it makes my code reusable instead of starting from scatch every time.
